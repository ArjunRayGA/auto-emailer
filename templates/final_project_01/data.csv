Explanation of domain could have been a little better. Good hypotheses on each slide. Take a close look at how you want to clean up or describe your data to determine the best way forward with either classification or regression.,,,,

Come meet with one of the EIT’s and we can help you craft a proper question to model.,,,,

The first question involves a ton of in-team and across-team interactions, fuzzy matching, probably sparse team combination data. Not easy.
2nd and 3rd ideas are very feasible. ",,,,

Beautifully formatted and laid out slides. Ideas seem tractable, although assessing truth value of features for some of the user-entered data may be tricky.",,,,

Pioneer data set could be a really interesting data set. making logical sense of the data (ie the 3d information, or other relationships between features) is probably outside the scope of the class. However, you could still work with these features in a more naive way and try to use them to explain the variability. a classifier for the type of “description” based on all or some of the features might be",,,,

Good job contextualizing  both datasets. It was nice to see that you included a data dict. The talk was too long, but you did end up doing 2X the work we had asked for! Only needed to do 3 ideas total! Dataset 1 problems were well scoped and reasonable to accomplish. Dataset 2 problems are very possible, but you probably should split the data set out into groups for each category and train a binary model for each category. If you want a multi-classifier, you will have to approximate one by making a binary classifier per category, since all of your training data only has one category per data point.",,,,
