Our records have indicated that you did **not meet requirements** for Project 2 and did **not resubmit the project** during the resubmission period.

Unfortunately, this means you are not currently on track to complete the program.

We welcome a resubmission, to be evaluated by a senior consultant, ASAP. Due to you not resubmitting on time, you will also have to complete an additional task with your project (see below). Your completion is contingent on this resubmission, as well as successful completion of future projects.

#Criteria for Resubmission

1. Successfully complete the project by completing [all requirements](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/full-stack-project/)

2.  Add a new feature to this project **OR** add a feature to your capstone project (meet with us to ensure it is a valid feature to get credit)

    #Project 2 Feature Suggestions
    **Backend**
    - Add new resource with a has_many :through relationship and integrate it into your project
    - Adding robust seed data so app is populated out of the box with useful data.

    **Frontend**
    - Add and use Handlebars for templating
    - Input validation for forms that take user input. For example, requiring an email address is a valid email address and password has a certain length and complexity.

    _Have another feature idea? Ask us first to ensure it is a valid feature to get credit._

#Please resubmit by responding with:
* The URL for your deployed client(github pages),
* The URL for your client repository,
* The URL for your API repository,
* And the URL for your deployed API (heroku)

Best,
General Assembly DAT-BOS-19 Instructional Team
